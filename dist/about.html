    <p>
      This site uses the <a href="http://pushshift.io">Pushshift API</a> to
      create way to browse banned subreddits and user profiles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The search forms allows for various special character to enable better
      searching.<br />
      <strong>Subreddit</strong> Inputfield allows you to seperate multiple
      subreddits using commas. To exclude a subreddit from your search you can
      use !. Same applies to the <strong>Author</strong> field.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Size</strong> defines how many results you want. By default it
      will look for 100 posts, which is also the maximum.<br />
      <strong>Score</strong> and <strong>Number of comments</strong> allows for
      the use of &lt;,&gt;,&lt;=,&gt;=. E.g. entering &gt;100 into Score, will
      only find Submissions/Comments with more than 100 Upvotes.<br />
      Pushshift does not store scores for many submissions and comments, so
      sorting by score will often not give you the results you want. Sorting by
      Comments might be preferable.<br />
      For really old threads, it is not possible to recreate the threads with
      all the comments. E.g.
      <a href="http://ihsoyct.github.io/index.html?comments=2aa52s"
        >http://ihsoyct.github.io/index.html?comments=2aa52s</a
      >
      here no comments will shows. There is nothing that can be done about that.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to see post beyond the limit of 1000 use the
      &lt;,&gt;,&lt;=,&gt;= to manually paginate through the results.
