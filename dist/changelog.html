      <ul>
        <li>Migrated to PullPush</li>
        <li>
            Pushshift shut down, an alternative showed up, but doesn't work yet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Only comments/submissions from /r/funny are loaded
        </li>
        <li>Currently it is not possible to load the comments for a specific reddit thread</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="section">16/01/2023</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Updated the site to the newest Pushshift API</li>
        <li>
          The new API currently does not support submissions before 03/11/2022. Those Hopefully, will be added to the
          Database at a later point, but this is out of my control.
        </li>
        <li>
          If you load a submission comments are now loaded seperately from the submissions. E.g. if the submission
          cannot be found, it will still try to load all the avaialable comments of that submission. This should
          somewhat remedy the first issue.
        </li>
        <li>Sort was changed to Order</li>
        <li>Sort_type was changed to Sort</li>
        <li>Before was changed to Until</li>
        <li>After was changed to Since</li>
        <li>Until and Since now support time in addition to date</li>
        <li>Added a permalink to the reddit submission you are viewing.</li>
        <li>Sorting by number of comments currently does not work.</li>
        <li>
          A Size that is not between 1 and 1000, will cause the API to error out, instead of clamping the value into the
          acceptable range. According to this the input element on this site was limited to only accept values between 1
          and 1000. Older links with a size > 1000 will no longer work
        </li>
      </ul>

          In the prior changelog, I talked about two different ways of loading comments. The old method had had several
          issues, due to poor maintenance of the API Endpoint of pushshift. The issue that some comment threads won't
          load at all, was fixed in the last changelog. However, then another issue started showing up. To identify the
          responses for each comment, there is a "parent_id" field returned by the API for each comment. The old method
          of loading comments would receive the wrong parent_id for each comment. Instead of it being the proper base36
          number, it would be the same number in base 10. This resulted in me not being able to assign a reply to its
          parent and the comments would be an "orphan". If a comment is orphaned(the parent cannot be found) this site
          will display it at the end and it would span the entire width of the site. Because of the failure of the old
          API Endpoint that I used, there was some(many) submission where this happened to every comment, making it
          pretty unreadable. This same issue does not exist within the new method of loading comments. I fixed this
          problem with the old method, but then realized that the old method would sometimes return comments in the
          wrong order (e.g. a child would appear before its parent) this would also result in orphaned comments. This
          again does not occur with the new method, and there would have been no easy fix for it. While ingesting the
          comments this tool heavily relies on receiving the parents before it receives the children. So I just decided
          to completely abandon the old method. Every search will now load the comments of submission using the new
          method.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pushshift also changed how many comments/submission can be loaded at a time to 100 from 1000. So the size
          parameter will not work for values past 100.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changed how orphaned comments appear. They no longer take on the full width and now have a slightly darker
          gray background.
        </li>
        <li>Changed the color of highlighted comments to a less obnoxious green.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="section">05/03/2022</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>The Size option works now. Range 1-1000</li>
        <li>
          The current way off loading comments to a submission, stopped working for newer submissions.
          <br />
          I added an alternative way to load comments. If the old way finds no comments the Backup method will
          automatically jump in <br/ > and should always be able to load the comments, if they exists within pushshift.
        </li>
        <li>
          This also fixed the issue of loading comments if a submission has more than 2000 comments. It will load around
          1000 comments at a time and then wait 10 seconds.
        </li>
